<h1>🔑 Basic Keylogger (Python)</h1>

<p>This project is a <strong>simple keylogger</strong> built in Python for <strong>educational and ethical research purposes only</strong>. It captures user keystrokes and logs them to a file for analysis.</p>

<h2>📌 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Records every keystroke typed on the keyboard</li>
  <li>Logs the keys into a local file (<code>log.txt</code>)</li>
  <li>Runs silently in the background</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚙️ How It Works</h2>
<p>The keylogger uses the <code>pynput</code> library to listen to keyboard events. Each key pressed is recorded and saved to a file for later review. This can be used to understand how keylogging works in cybersecurity.</p>

<h2>📁 Output</h2>
<p>All recorded keystrokes are saved in a plain text file named <code>log.txt</code> in the same directory as the script.</p>

<h2>⚠️ Ethical Usage Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This project is intended for ethical hacking practice, research, and learning. Do not use this software to track or monitor individuals without their knowledge and consent. Unauthorized use of keyloggers may violate local, state, or federal laws.</p>

<h2>🚀 How to Run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install required libraries: <code>pip install pynput</code></li>
  <li>Run the script: <code>python keylogger.py</code></li>
  <li>Keystrokes will be logged in <code>log.txt</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>📚 Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li><code>pynput</code> Python package</li>
</ul>
